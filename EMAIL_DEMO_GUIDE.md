## 🔧 Technical Considerations

### Security Notes
- **Ngrok tunnels** are temporary and secure
- **Cloud deployments** may require environment variables
- **Local demos** are most secure but require setup

### Performance Tips
- **Ngrok free tier** has bandwidth limits
- **Cloud free tiers** may have usage restrictions
- **Local demos** have no limitations

### Backup Plans
- Always have **screenshots** as backup
- Include **DEMO_GUIDE.md** for context
- Provide **contact info** for live demonstrations

## 🎯 Recommended Approach

**For immediate sharing:** Use **Ngrok** (5 minutes setup)
**For professional presentation:** Create **screen recording** + **cloud deployment**
**For technical audience:** Provide **portable demo package**
**For executives:** Use **PowerPoint** with screenshots and business value
